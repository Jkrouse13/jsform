# jsform
- Using the form data, create the HTML form you see in the screenshot here in the repo. You'll need to write your own CSS styles as well.
# hints
- You will need to link both .js files to the HTML file
- To call data from an object you would do something like `object.type`
  - Which might return something like `text`
- As usual it might be worth trying to play around with the data in console before digging in
